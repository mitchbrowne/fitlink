### Overview

Social web platform, like Instagram, where you can post online workouts you’ve done! Users can follow their friends and see what workouts they're doing! Fills the gap where a lot of people currently want to do home workouts, however need to search and find good workout videos. This makes that task easy and enjoyable. Users add hashtags to their posts to give others an idea of what the workout is about, as well as @tag other friends who did it with them. All these posts get put onto a users feed. A user can also perform a search via hashtags to explore other workout videos. Give your friends hearts and do workouts together!

### Objective

The objective of this project is to:

- No brief! Just build a web application from the ground up using both what we've learnt over the past 12 weeks and any additional material.
- To demonstrate mastery of topics covered during this course (Javascript, React, Databases (NoSQL), Client and Server Side Frameworks, Deployment, Design, Html, CSS, and much much more...).

### What I've Learned

- **Single Page Applications**: Routing and moving data on one single web app
- **Cloud Database Querying**: Reading and writing to Google Firebase's Cloud Firestore (NoSQL)
- **Error Handling**: Ensuring users are led through the application seamlessly
- **User Authentication/Permissions**: Sign Up, Sign In, Sign Out
- **Responsiveness**: Application can go for big screen, to small screen with no noticeable jumps!
- **Content Delivery Network**: Image upload functionality utilising CDN's
- **User Experience**: Collaboration with UX designers to build high-fidelity prototypes and user flows

### Proud as Punch

- **Complete Site**: The application is completely running. It is how I'd expect the MVP to look, feel and work like.
- **Actual Users**: Friends have signed up and used the platform. Posting workouts, following friends, hearting posts and tagging others.
- **NoSQL**: First time building an app with a NoSQL database. Steep learning curve and multiple iterations of the data structure, but positive outcome!
- **Following/Followers**: A responsive following/followers system allows user to see friend's content and see who is following them and who they are following.
- **Bootstrap**: Bootstrap is a time saver, as much as I like to style myself, Bootstrap is quick and looks great. The responsiveness is especially impressive.

### Just Missed The Cut

- **Image Optimisation**: Using image optimisation libraries to compress user images prior to upload, hence reducing page loading time and minimising storage space
- **Test Driven Development**: Engineer it so it can't break. Utilise tests throughout the process for faster and sturdier development
- **Email Authentication**: Automatic email to user to verify email address
- **Push Notifications**: When someone follows, hearts or tags you in a post
- **Refactoring**: Written clean code with indentation, however refactoring would do a tremendous job at improving the sites performance
